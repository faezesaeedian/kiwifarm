# Knight Moves Project Notes

This document provides detailed notes and documentation for the project, including information on chess notation, classes, code documentation, command-line parameters, configuration files, additional files, Docker setup, error handling, linting, and logging.

---

## **1. Algebraic (Chess) Notation**
- The project uses algebraic notation for representing chess moves:
  - Chessboard squares are labeled using columns (`a` to `h`) and rows (`1` to `8`).
  - For example, `e4` represents the square at column `e` and row `4`.
  - Knight moves are encoded as tuples like `(2, 1)` indicating relative moves.

---

## **2. Classes**
- **`Knight` Class**:
  - Represents the knight piece and its moves.
  - Includes methods to calculate valid moves and paths.
- **`ChessBoard` Class**:
  - Models the chessboard and its constraints.
  - Provides methods for validating positions and generating moves.
- **`GraphGenerator` Class**:
  - Generates the graph of knight moves using Graphviz.
  - Exports `.dot` files for visualization.

---

## **3. Code Documentation**
- The code is documented using Python docstrings and inline comments.
- Example:
  ```python
  def generate_moves(position):
      """
      Generate all possible knight moves from a given position.

      Args:
          position (tuple): The current position of the knight (x, y).

      Returns:
          list: A list of valid moves as tuples.
      """
      pass
Each function and class includes descriptions of arguments, return values, and functionality.
4. Command Line Parameters
The project supports various command-line parameters:
--start: Specify the starting position (e.g., --start e4).
--end: Specify the target position (e.g., --end g6).
--output: Define the output format (e.g., Graphviz .dot or PDF).
Example usage:
bash
Always show details

Copy code
python main.py --start e4 --end g6 --output graph.pdf
5. Config File (JSONC Format)
Configuration is stored in config.jsonc:
jsonc
Always show details

Copy code
{
    // Chessboard dimensions
    "board": {
        "rows": 8,
        "columns": 8"
    },
    // Knight's moves
    "knight_moves": [
        [2, 1], [2, -1], [-2, 1], [-2, -1],
        [1, 2], [1, -2], [-1, 2], [-1, -2]
    ]
}
6. Extra Files
Graphviz DOT File:
Located at knight_paths.dot.dot.
Represents the graph of knight moves.
Includes positions as nodes and possible moves as edges.
Visual Outputs:
Generated PDFs or images (e.g., graph.pdf) for better graph readability.
Other Assets:
Any required diagrams or images can be included in the output directory.
7. Docker Compose
A Dockerfile is included to containerize the application.
To run the project using Docker:
bash
Always show details

Copy code
docker build -t knight_moves .
docker run knight_moves
8. Error/Exception Handling
Errors are managed using Python exceptions:
Invalid input positions raise ValueError.
File I/O operations are wrapped in try-except blocks.
Example:
python
Always show details

Copy code
try:
    with open("config.jsonc", "r") as config_file:
        config = json.load(config_file)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Configuration file not found.")
9. Linting
Linting is enforced using flake8:
Run linting:
bash
Always show details

Copy code
flake8 main.py utils/
10. Logging
Logging is implemented using the logging module.
Logs are written to a file (logs.txt) and include:
Timestamps
Log levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.)
Messages
Example:
python
Always show details

Copy code
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='logs.txt', level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("Application started.")
